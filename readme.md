# increase the sale of cohort-based courses

The e-learning market, which includes online courses, was valued at **$250 billion in 2023** and is expected to reach **$490.20 billion by 2029**, growing at a CAGR of **11.88%**[Arizton](https://www.arizton.com/market-reports/e-learning-market-size-2024)

There are 3 ways to deliver education online:

DIY, semi-private and 1-on-1

DIY or self paced have failed to educate effectively:
- traditional online courses see 6% completion rates
- 70% of enrolled customers never start their paid courses.

The most profitable model for course creators is semi-private because the perceived value of a high touch service is much higher than video-on-demand, allowing course creators to sell their knowledge for a higher price

IntuitFlow is a semi-private learning platform
**Semi-private model**: 8 students work in real-time with an instructor for a personalized and interactive learning environment.

It's better for students: **10x more likely to have a successful learning outcome**
live cohort classes achieve a 75% completion rate.

let's take fireship.io as an example he sells $20 video courses about Linux and JavaScript frameworks

what if he could also offer a $700 guided version with a minimal time investment and zero upfront cost to him?

our offer to him is
**we will find and pay an instructor to deliver his curriculum** in return of a percent of the revenue

**The benefits or course creators**:
They can focus on what they do best - packaging and marketing their courses - while still offering the premium, high-touch experience that cohort-based learning provides. They can command higher prices for their courses, scale beyond their personal time limitations, and reach a larger audience

   - Enhanced Discoverability within our app ecosystem.
   - Creators can link their own Discord server, engaging directly with students.
   - Easy video testimonial collection through live sessions.
   - Verified reviews from paying customers who completed courses.
   - We can provide skilled instructors for creators who want to focus solely on content and marketing.
   - Streamlined payments and ability to offer trusted money-back guarantees.
   -  Not competing with creators: We recognize that online course buyers are likely to purchase multiple courses, expanding the overall market.

the value proposition for students is:
instead of paying for information

we guarantee you will be able to (do this thing) in (this time period) or your money back
you have to show up to every class and do the assignments, we provide accountability.

this model ensures they receive the benefits of live, instructor-led sessions, including real-time feedback, personalized attention, and the opportunity to learn alongside peers. They get the marketing and curriculum from the course creators they admire, combined with instruction from skilled educators who can effectively facilitate learning

## The Problem
- 85% of instructors on major platforms make less than $100/month selling DIY courses
- platforms lack proper guidance but one-on-one mentoring is too expensive for most learners.


**Why now?**
Because there were not as many people like Fireship.io selling courses as there is now.

the creator economy, which includes these elements, was estimated to grow from $127.65 billion in 2023 to $528.39 billion by 2030, growing at a CAGR of 22.5% [coherent](https://www.coherentmarketinsights.com/industry-reports/global-creator-economy-market#:~:text=North%20America%3A%20North%20America%20is,by%20influencers%20and%20individual%20creators)

People are just learning the power of selling information products and utilizing social media to sell high margin products.

How will we be able to get instructors to provide this tutoring service?
Because these instructors are making $30 an hour, selling one-on-one tutoring. But if they sell a group of eight, and they sell it for $10 an hour each, then they will be making more money for the same amount of teaching time.

how are going to build an audience to sell courses too?

**free focus club**
 Community-driven accountability system to keep learners engaged and motivated.
      - Users can join focus sessions with peers, set goals, and track progress.
      - Leverages Discord's social features for organic growth and engagement.

Born in Sudan, I challenged societal norms from a young age, This independent mindset led me to drop out of high school and pursue entrepreneurship.
