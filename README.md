With IntuitFlow, customers can prioritize tasks, eliminate distractions, and set realistic goals. We help you stay focused on long-term goals in a world full of distractions and instant gratification.
- The mission: **help people decrease overwhelm and increase productivity.**

## Quick intro
- I used to hold a marketing position in an early fintech startup (Tutipay)
- I'm 23 with diagnosed with ADHD, but I can't afford medication. 
- I have built a web app to help me with motivation and focus It has helped me tremendously, i have shown it to other and received positive feedback

## The main product: Live Cohort based courses
- More interactive than DIY platforms (kajabi, udemy and skillShare)
- less expensive than one-on-one mentoring (intro.co, GrowthMentor and Plato).
- **semi-private model**: 8 students working in real time with an instructor
	- more personalized and beneficial experience
## The Masterplan: 3 Stage Approach
1. **WhyCombinator**
	- single purpose app to answer one question: "How would you like to spend your life?"
2. Focus club hosted on discord
3. Live Cohort based courses hosted on the intuitflow app

The app and all of it's features can be used by one individual to help them get work done
but the paid feature is you can join a class hosted by teacher to learn and most importantly **DO** work with others while being guided with a teacher


## 1. WhyCombinator
"how would you like to spend your life?" answering this question will add meaning to life and enhance its quality.
there is a line of questioning that can be used to slowly ramp a person until they are ready to answer this big question
This apps main purpose for us is it will be used as a funnel and move the customers to the discord server

### The problem WhyCombinator solves: The Focus problem

It's a painful problem not knowing what they should do.  

The app helps you answer the question "how would you like to spend your life?"
answering this question will add meaning to life and enhance its quality.  
there is a line of questioning that can be used to slowly ramp a person until they are ready to answer the big question  
  
The app's main purpose for us is that it will be used to capture leads and move the customers down the funnel where they can start doing the thing they said they want to do

- Law of attraction: Keep thinking of the goal
- Atomic habits: Goals are good, but systems are better
- Common advice: "Don't overcomplicate it"

### Why These Ideas Are Popular

- They are all indirect & unique
	- unique as in they address the same problem using a different metaphor  
	- indirect because You have to talk to them about their **perceived** problem 
- they move you towards answering the question: "How would you like to spend your life?"
- People are unaware of the real nature of the problem (they think it's motivation)
- If you had a clear and concrete goal, if you could answer the question "how would you like to spend your life?" You would not find value in these ideas

>“It isn't normal to know what we want. It is a rare and difficult psychological achievement.” - Abraham Maslow

- We want to know what we want

This Desire to know stems from **overwhelm**
overwhelm is not knowing what do do or choose.

The popularity of these activities reflect the human desire for self-knowledge and the need to understand oneʼs place in the world. They often provide a means for individuals to reflect on their personal values, beliefs, and experiences. Moreover, they can offer a sense of comfort and control in an unpredictable world by giving the illusion of foresight and self-determination. The popularity of such activities across different cultures indicates that the quest for meaning is a universal aspect of the human experience. It underscores the importance of narrative and storytelling in identity formation, as people use these tools to construct and make sense of their life stories.

This is my case for the demand for WhyCombinator

making an app that asks you simple questions

The app would start with a simple self exploration quiz where you swipe left or right based on what you want

**![](https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/slidesz/AGV_vUdj1EghbDNB1KX3ZBY_3t5ApmaVr0Y2z4Uf8J5_CCPp49Ub411D99W8A_bdsnIkL63KPcoIlH3iHVokBlva1q4QsZmpDBkm3L3n73wtclFbcnOSJs31BtMZYFLxBL2XCqGioER9kaY_rwVVWJ6_bPAEKVb-lhKS=s2048?key=vhyQIrxFMVYBLo48lVS8OQ)

A friendly ai powered avatar Will give you affirmations along the way It will start asking you bigger questions “Writing” is hard but ai powered **chat** is not

You pay and get a report that presents all your values and desires in a nice shareable format
but we want to encourage people to take actions to make their dreams come true

the ai avatar would then ask you "Hey, so you said you want to learn how to code because you want to become a software engineer. Would it benefit you to be in a group with other people who are trying to learn the same thing?"
"Would it be more likely for you to succeed if you had accountability? If you scheduled time? If you...(list the features of the focus club)"

### Does this work?
Self Authoring Program Created by Jordan Peterson


is a series of questions where you are prompted to write about your past and feature,
it's basically guided journaling exercises to invoke a self reflection

example questions:
> - If you could choose only one thing that you could do better, what would it be?
> - People you automatically admire have qualities that you would like to possess or imitate. Identifying those qualities can help you determine who it is that you want to be. Take a moment to think about the two or three people you most admire. Who are they? Which qualities do they possess that you wish you had?
> - Friends and associates are an important part of a meaningful, productive life. Take a moment to consider your social network. Think about the friends you might want to have, and the connections you might want to make. It is perfectly reasonable to choose friends and associates who are good for you. Describe your ideal social life.

he tested it on 85 students who were struggling academically, and the students' collective GPA rose by 29 percent in a single semester. 
The problem with it is: Itʼs tough to do 4 hours of work! Writing is hard.
Courses have a 3-6% completion rate most donʼt even start the courses they pay $299 for.

So what's the percentage that completed this Self Authoring Program by JpB?

### The New Way

So the app would start with simple self exploration quiz where you swipe left or right based on what you want

**but why do it this way?**
because the success of Smash or pass
because the app #21, #36, #37, #42 in the Trivia category are **All** Would you rather games

- The unique mechanism of a chatbot will inspire hope because chatting is much easier than journaling

A friendly ai powered avatar Will give you affirmations along the way It will start asking you bigger questions like the ones from the JP course
You can pay and get a report that presents all your values and desires in a nice shareable
## The Focus Club

### Aspirational Brand & exclusive community
“A fit body, a calm mind, a house full of love. These things cannot be bought they must be earned.”—naval Ravikant

- How many people read that and thought to themselves 'I want that' when before they didnʼt?
- How many people heard of YC and the success stories of founders and thought ‘I want thatʼ?
- How many people watched the social network and thought to themselves ‘I want thatʼ?

When we hear the stories of successful we hear words like “extreme”, “intense”. “risk-taker” or ”ruthless” I want to change that into something more inspiring.

I will change that into the framing of **Seriousness** 
>Serious = someone who lives a meaningful examined life without regrets who has clear priorities, basically everything we all strive to be and have
>un-serious people are the mids and normies drifting through life

people are going to want to be seen as Serious.

Serious people are self actualized successful people (what we all want to be) people are going to want to be seen as Serious
Do you consider yourself serious? jump through these hoops to prove it Buy my products, serious people do that The serious brand is about successful people How many people are going to hear the stories and think to themselves "i want that!". "I want to be Serious". 

"This is where Iʼm meant to be right now, doing exactly what Iʼm doing"- things serious people say

I can create a community larger than Jordan peterson, Andrew Tate or the whole manifestation thing.

but let's go back to reality what are actually trying to build here?

Today's productivity apps make big promises, aiming to be the hub of user's life. Userʼs then spend a lot of time adapting to the tool. but because they thought they could keep track of everything, They start noticing limitations. users then complain and the developers respond by creating more features. which makes the app even more complex and then a new app shows up that promises a different workflow. People get excited and they jump. the challenge with many productivity apps is that they focus more on the act of managing productivity rather than facilitating actual productive work. 

these apps can sometimes lead users to believe they are making significant progress in their work or personal goals simply by interacting with the app itself—through organizing, planning, or setting up complex systems. This can create a sense of achievement from the act of planning rather than the act of doing.


### Leveraging the social graph of Discord
>Habit formation requires recurring organic exposure on social networks.

discord has a feature that shows what game all your friends are playing in Realtime with a button to join them. this will be our main acquisition strategy (Social engineered word of mouth)

There are many servers on discord that have 400 people on video calls working simultaneously, we will provide an app that will simply enhance their experience

### The Perceived Problem

74% of workers [report](https://research.udemy.com/research_report/udemy-depth-2018-workplace-distraction-report/) being distracted at work. This distraction isn't just a minor inconvenience—it leads to 46% feeling unmotivated and 41% feeling stressed. employees say that ‘better time management' would drastically reduce stress, productivity & focus This basically means that most People think they need “Better time management”, they [think](https://www.timewatch.com/blog/time-management-statistics-in-2022/) that is the problem.

But people's actions say's different.

### The Real Problem
Productivity forums talk about To-Do list apps. They talk about note-taking nobody is talking about time management instead, the talk is about Zettelkasten, knowledge and task managements techniques and apps

The market is ripe for a productivity solution that truly understands the modern user’s needs—less complexity, more action. As the culture shifts towards genuine efficiency, our app meets this moment by offering a tool that turns intention into accomplishment.

We are not going to appeal to the masses by creating an everything app (second brain)
#### The emerging trend of simple and clear productivity that works
![](https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/slidesz/AGV_vUfyDyVhzMGRv8l2jAjgqd5amgb3KcCVqu2yqPlXoc2_QSBhhARIPqOYJS7nOXnLhJ_1wimutNOy4SirPjDszqDAissCKxvQD9udwlGVSyAIOC6CEh9N9rNjIQj2OlqHThBQvX5I2ekhj-LRLr59Ls2kNYHzHn8=s2048?key=vhyQIrxFMVYBLo48lVS8OQ)


We are not challenging anything we are moving with the flow of the new trend of abandoning overly complex productivity tools.

people are now saying: You don’t need to master complicated software just to keep track of your task, nor is Vim going to make you a better programmer. We're moving away from the common productivity methods like linking endless notes, complex filing systems, and extensive planning frameworks. Our goal is simple and clear productivity that works for everyone.

the vibes are shifting, there's a new emerging trend of simple and clear productivity that works.

We are going to do it by creating a simple and beautiful app that helps people accomplish their tasks (we are focusing on people trying to learn)

intuitively, they know the problem is **overwhelm**

>Overwhelm =  ⬆️demand+⬇️certainty

The problem is not that sometimes it takes a few minutes to find your folder and notes. The problem is that you're overwhelmed.

Overwhelm is a symptom of high demand and in low certainty

>Artists and Athletes practice so that they could improve their performance. What if knowledge workers could also practice and Improve their performance?

how we are tackling this:
1. Decrease mental demand:
   - Prioritize
	   - before you start working you are prompted to state what you are trying to accomplish
		   - if you have no clue
		   - “What's the ONE thing I can do, such that by doing it, everything else will be easier or unnecessary?”
   - Eliminate distractions
	   - Instead of fighting the urge we would features to block you from accessing distractions for the duration of the session
   - Delegate/schedule
	   - an idea or a task pops up while you are in a session. a notes feature can help you preserve that idea and continue working

1. Increase certainty:
   - Prepare
	   - breakdown the task into a clear next steps
   - Clarify
	   - "Why is this important and valuable?"
   - Set realistic expectations
	   - after the focus session is over we reflect with user on how much they accomplished and how much were they expecting
